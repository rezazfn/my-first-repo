Chase Atlantic's Website
This project (Assignment 1), 
This project is for ID Assignment 1, it tests our knowledge in using html, css, and js. We were tasked to create an official website for a band/company. This is my first time creating my own website with animations and all from scratch, unlike figma/google sites/wix. It was extremely difficult as it is all new to me so I had trouble submitting this on time.

Design Process
THe main colours are black, red, and white to represent the band's iconic colour scheme which lets fans easily recognise the website. This website is for existing fans to stay updated and new fans that are interested to learn more about the band. I made this website to compile all information of Chase Atlantic to make it easier to access like having all their socials, booking info, shop, and music all in one website. To achieve this goal, I had to find all these information and make different pages for different categories. Also, there are many animations for hovering which indicates where users are clicking.

Features
5 Pages - Home, About, Bookings/Tickets, Merch, Discography
There is a navigator bar at the top of every page for users to easily access different pages. There is also a footer under every page that has an input allowing users to fill in their email to recieve updates. There is also links to all their socials and platforms in the about page to learn more about the band. There is also a announcement to let users know if there are any upcoming concerts and a remind me button at the tickets page for users to stay updated of any upcoming concerts. The merch page displays all their products with pricings. The discography page announces the latest album/single released by the band and there is a image carousel with all their previous songs they have released.

Some features I would like to add is a music player and pop up messages after clicking things.

Technologies Used
I used extensions like prettier, golive and autosave to make my coding easier and more efficient
I also used ChatGPT for advice and to help with some bugs when I was stuck. https://chat.openai.com/

Some bugs I discovered was the responsive media for mobile viewing not aligning properly and the button in the tickets page not positioning correctly in mobile views. During the process, there were many small errors and mistakes made.

Credits and inspiration for the Image Carousell from https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/js-css-carousel/blob/main/index.html. I also watched youtube tutorials for the navigation, css, and javascript.

The text for the About section, the previous concerts were obtained from Songkick

Photos used were obtained from Pinterest, Spotify (Screenshots), Official Chase Atlantic Website, Google
I was inspired by the band, official Chase Atlantic website, and the Veeps website.
