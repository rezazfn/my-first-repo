Chase Atlantic's Website
This project (Assignment 1), 
This project is for ID Assignment 1, it tests our knowledge in using html, css, and js. We were tasked to create an official website for a band/company. This is my first time creating my own website with animations and all from scratch, unlike figma/google sites/wix. It was extremely difficult as it is all new to me so I had trouble submitting this on time. 

Website’s Purpose
As a Chase Atlantic (Band) Website, the purpose of the website is to have an official and professional image with all their information collated for easier access. It also serves as a store where fans can buy their merchandise, and a place to connect and engage with fans. 
My Goals as the owner is to Promote the band to give them more exposure, traction, and awareness from people to grow their fanbase. Selling merchandise and tickets to increase profits. Distribute content, information, and announcements easily.

Target Audience & Their Goals
Target Audience: Fans of Chase Atlantic and those who are new to the band (exploring)
Goals: (Existing Fans) Keeping up with the band, buying merch, booking concert tickets, checking on their new releases. (Newcomers) Learn about the band, finding their socials, exploring the type of music they have.

Design Process
THe main colours are black, red, and white to represent the band's iconic colour scheme as seen in their previous albums and merch which lets fans easily recognise the website and makes it distinctive and true to their concept. This website is for existing fans to stay updated and new fans that are interested to learn more about the band. I made this website to compile all information of Chase Atlantic to make it easier to access like having all their socials, booking info, shop, and music all in one website. To achieve this goal, I had to find all these information and make different pages for different categories. The website layout will be minimalistic and edgy so that its simple to use and remains aesthetically pleasing that matches the colour theme/concept. Also, there are many animations for hovering which indicates where users are clicking.

Technologies Used
I used extensions like prettier, golive and autosave to make my coding easier and more efficient
I also used ChatGPT for advice and to help with some bugs when I was stuck. https://chat.openai.com/

Some bugs I discovered was the responsive media for mobile viewing not aligning properly and the button in the tickets page not positioning correctly in mobile views. During the process, there were many small errors and mistakes made.

Credits and inspiration for the Image Carousell from https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/js-css-carousel/blob/main/index.html. I also watched youtube tutorials for the navigation, css, and javascript.

The text for the About section, the previous concerts were obtained from Songkick

Photos used were obtained from Pinterest, Spotify (Screenshots), Official Chase Atlantic Website, Google
I was inspired by the band, official Chase Atlantic website, and the Veeps website.
