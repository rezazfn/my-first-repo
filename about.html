<!-- About -->
<section id="about">
    <div class="info">
        <p> Chase Atlantic is an Australian R&B band and production trio from Cairns, Queensland, formed in 2014.
            The group consists of three members: Christian Anthony, Clinton Cave and Mitchel Cave.
            Chase Atlantic has a unique style of music, which, according to the band, is "conjured up dark alternative pop punctuated by rock and R&B."
            Throughout their four years of making music, their music style has changed from an alternative pop sound to a more alternative R&B sound.
        </p>
        <p>Chase Atlantic formed when Clinton asked the other two to help him record a project for university. Dalliance, the new band’s first EP, dropped on May 26, 2014 and was a mix between pop punk and pop rock.
            It released another EP in February of the following year. Called Nostalgia, the EP included the song “Friends,” which soon appeared in several edits on the website Tumblr.
            Later that year, Benji and Joel Madden took notice of the band, and signed the boys to MDDN Management.</p>
